## About Me

I’m a **Data Engineer with a software engineering past**.  
I enjoy working where **systems, data, and logic meet**.

These days I spend most of my time:
- moving data **reliably** (and fixing it when it breaks),
- tuning **Spark jobs that refuse to behave**,
- designing data models that **actually make sense**,
- keeping big data platforms **secure, fast, and boring** (boring is good).

I like understanding things **deeply** — not just using them.

## 🧯 Data Incidents I Survived  
*(the real résumé)*

> Every data engineer has scars. These are some of mine.

- 🔥 **Warehouse deleted in production**  
  Recovered by prioritizing dependencies, restoring from DR, reprocessing Spark jobs, and backfilling critical tables — reports delivered the same day.

- 🐌 **Queries that never returned**  
  Tracked down Hive small-files issues, fixed compaction & storage layout, and restored query reliability.

- ⏰ **Pipelines finishing at 4 PM (not acceptable)**  
  Optimized Airflow concurrency, Spark/YARN resources, and moved to event-driven DAGs → pipelines completed by 6 AM.

- 🌪️ **Full production ownership during team absence**  
  Ran Airflow, Spark, and Informatica pipelines solo for weeks — zero downtime, multiple incidents resolved.

- 🔁 **Replication stuck at 70% forever**  
  Diagnosed platform issues, tuned jobs, and stabilized cross-cluster replication to 100%.

## A Bit of My Story

- Started as a **full-stack & mobile developer**
- Fell in love with **data & analysis**
- Ended up in **big data platforms & banking systems**
- Slowly moving toward **data architecture & system design**

I still enjoy clean code, good abstractions, and well-designed systems — just at **data scale** now.

## When I’m Not Working With Data

- 🎮 Strategy games (Age of Empires, grand strategy, anything with thinking)
- 📚 Learning how distributed systems *really* work
- ✍️ Organizing knowledge (Notion, notes, diagrams)
- ☕ Over-engineering simple things for fun
